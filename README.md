When it comes to making business decisions or finding patterns in any given data, be it in CSV format or an API for crawling data, or even databases our software is a one-stop solution for all your data insights needs.

## Problem addressed: 
Dynamic Clustering of data can improve data processing efficiencies manifold.
Let’s say there is an entity with the initial set of parameters. The system is expected to group entities based on “similar”parameters. “Similarity” could mean different things for different parameters. For example, if we consider users as the entity.

For this we have designed a system that is easily configurable on the number and type of parameters and clustering rules. In this the data is filtered not only on the basis of parameters or clustering rules but we can also run SQL queries on the cluster data that is stored post clustering and give an output which is highly user-understandable.

## Objectives 
* To design a system that is easily configurable on the number and type of parameters and clustering rules.
* The clustering needs to occur in real time. The values for the parameters are to be fed asynchronously to the system.

## Features
* Clustering on the basis of API's .
* Clustering on the basis of CSV files.
* Clustering from the data pulled from local databases.
* Provision of a query interface where the user can run query on specific clusters.
* Provision of an interface for the users to perform filtering on the basis of parameters and rules.
* Docker-based deployment facility for improved scalability.

## Brownie Points
* Provide users with an interactive UI where they can see all the clusters getting formed in real-time.
* Providing an option for the users to select and zoom into the interested clusters.
